        <b>How hard will it be to prosecute Cosby?</b>
Defense attorney Barry Slotnick, best known for successfully defending New York City subway vigilante Bernie Goetz, said the burden on the prosecution is high.

"This case is over with. Too much time has passed," he told NBC News. "The major question the jury will have for the accuser is, 'Where have you been and why did you settle?' I think Cosby's position is going to be yes, I had sex with her and it was consensual."

Slotnick said he doesn't expect the judge will allow Cosby's other accusers to testify. "Cosby will be on trial for allegedly assaulting one woman, not dozens of women," Slotnick said. "The jury is going to have to sort out who is telling the truth and who isn't."

Eddie Hayes, a famed New York attorney who was fictionalized in "Bonfire of the Vanities" and who has represented everyone from Sean "Diddy" Combs to the families of 9/11 victims, said it will be "very" tough to convict Cosby — especially if the judge bars other accusers from testifying.
